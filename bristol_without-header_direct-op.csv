Balance Sheet Template,(Incr) / Decr in Debtors,What is Receivables under Cash flows from operating activities in Cash flow statements for year 2024?,"Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds of sale with
the carrying amount and are recognised within the income statement.
In line with IAS 23, within the Statutory Accounts and Financial Statements,
borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset (an
asset necessarily taking a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended
use) are capitalised as part of the asset. However, within the Regulatory Reporting,
in a deviation from IAS 23 and in line with Ofwat RAG 3.14, borrowing costs are not
capitalised.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 99

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

are incremental to the Company. Assets transferred from customers are recognised
at fair value.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds of sale with
the carrying amount and are recognised within the income statement.
In line with IAS 23, within the Statutory Accounts and Financial Statements,
borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset (an
asset necessarily taking a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended
use) are capitalised as part of the asset. However, within the Regulatory Reporting,
in a deviation from IAS 23 and in line with Ofwat RAG 3.14, borrowing costs are not
capitalised.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 99

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Fixed assets have been allocated based on their principal use. For assets which are used across the business units (i.e. management and general), they have been assumed
to have principal use within wholesale and then allocated between water and wastewater.
The net book value includes £501.077m in respect of assets during construction. This excludes capitalised interest which is not recognised in the regulated accounts in
accordance with the Regulatory Accounting Guidelines.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m"

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.

Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.

is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.

innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Balance Sheet Template,Current Taxation,What is Total current tax expense under nan in Consolidated income statement for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position."

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Borrowings above.
The table above reflects the position of the appointed business and excludes the £2.384m of non–appointed cash assumed within cash. RCV at 31 March 2024 was £4,837.8m
resulting in a gearing ratio of 68.298% for the appointed business.
Adjusted gearing of 68.249% is based on the total cash position (rather than the cash position of the appointed business only).
Fixed and floating debt costs and interest rates are equivalent to the cash interest payments. Only index–linked debt has a differential between the interest charges and cash
interest payments, where RPI or CPI is accreted into the loan balance.
Total Borrowings Shadow RCV
For the purposes of table 1F, which has been completed separately for SWB South West Water also maintains a shadow RCV that reflects the underlying
and BRL, the net debt has been split as follows: performance of South West Water over the regulatory period.

spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,

The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.

Balance Sheet Template,Deferred Tax / future reserve,What is Deferred taxation under Non-Current Liabilities in Group and parent company balance sheets for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.

Balance Sheet Template,Deferred Tax / future reserve,What is Deferred tax liabilities under Non-Current Liabilities in Consolidated Statement of financial Position for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position."
Balance Sheet Template,Deferred Taxation,What is Deferred tax under nan in Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position."
Balance Sheet Template,Deferred Taxation,What is Deferred taxation under nan in Consolidated profit and loss account for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Balance Sheet Template,Depreciation,What is Depreciation Charge under nan in Consolidated income statement for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Balance Sheet Template,Due from group & related Cos < 1 yr,What is Group relief under Current assets in Balance sheets for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Balance Sheet Template,Due from group & related Cos < 1 yr,What is Loan to joint venture under Current Assets in Consolidated and Company Balance sheet for year 2024?,"1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m"

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Balance Sheet Template,Intangible – Group Assets,What is Group Goodwill under Non-Current Assets in Group and Company Balance sheets for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Balance Sheet Template,Intangible – Other,What is Brand values under Non-Current Assets in Consolidated balance sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Chief Executive Officer pay ratio
Our CEO pay ratio stands at 21:1 for the median employee. The ratio is higher than in 2022/23 when the CEO opted to forgo all her variable pay for that year. It is lower than
the ratio in preceding years. The changes are partially due to our strategy of developing pay for front line roles, which has led to an increase in median pay

Option A has been used for the calculations as per the disclosure regulations. The employees at the lower quartile, median and upper quartile (P25, P50, and P75,
respectively) have been determined based on a calculation of total remuneration for the financial year 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.
• Basic salary for part-time employees and new joiners within the applicable period have been converted to full-time equivalents for the purpose of the calculations.
• Estimated values for employee P11d data have been used in the calculation for 2022/23 to establish the ordering of employees, given the timing of publication. This has
been validated and has not led to any change in the published ratio.
The total remuneration of 2023/24 for the employees identified at P25, P50 and P75 is £31,661, £41,512, and £51,538, respectively. The base salary of 2023/24 for the
employees identified at P25, P50 and P75 is £29,051, £35,878, and £26,408, respectively. The individual at P75 received a large amount of variable pay during the year,

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.
Non–appointed
---
Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m"

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

Borrowings above.
The table above reflects the position of the appointed business and excludes the £2.384m of non–appointed cash assumed within cash. RCV at 31 March 2024 was £4,837.8m
resulting in a gearing ratio of 68.298% for the appointed business.
Adjusted gearing of 68.249% is based on the total cash position (rather than the cash position of the appointed business only).
Fixed and floating debt costs and interest rates are equivalent to the cash interest payments. Only index–linked debt has a differential between the interest charges and cash
interest payments, where RPI or CPI is accreted into the loan balance.

Balance Sheet Template,Loans < 1yr – Others*,What is Loan notes under Current liabilities in Consolidated statement of financial position for year 2024?,"1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Borrowings above.
The table above reflects the position of the appointed business and excludes the £2.384m of non–appointed cash assumed within cash. RCV at 31 March 2024 was £4,837.8m
resulting in a gearing ratio of 68.298% for the appointed business.
Adjusted gearing of 68.249% is based on the total cash position (rather than the cash position of the appointed business only).
Fixed and floating debt costs and interest rates are equivalent to the cash interest payments. Only index–linked debt has a differential between the interest charges and cash
interest payments, where RPI or CPI is accreted into the loan balance.
Total Borrowings Shadow RCV
For the purposes of table 1F, which has been completed separately for SWB South West Water also maintains a shadow RCV that reflects the underlying

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m"

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position."

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and

company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.

Balance Sheet Template,Long term tax recoverable,What is Deferred tax asset under Non-Current Assets in Consolidated and company statement of financial position for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Balance Sheet Template,Marketable Investments,What is Short-term bank deposits under Current Assets in Consolidated balance sheet for year 2024?,"1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Actuarial gains/losses are net of tax and allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member. This is applied to the activities associated with
their employment history weighted by the time spent in each role, consistent with the approach to allocating pension contributions.
Other comprehensive income relates to cash flow hedges held in the appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 109

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.
Non–appointed
---
Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Balance Sheet Template,Pension fund liability,What is Defined benefit pension scheme deficit under Non-Current Liabilities in Group balance sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m"

Actuarial gains/losses are net of tax and allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member. This is applied to the activities associated with
their employment history weighted by the time spent in each role, consistent with the approach to allocating pension contributions.
Other comprehensive income relates to cash flow hedges held in the appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 109

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

are incremental to the Company. Assets transferred from customers are recognised
at fair value.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds of sale with
the carrying amount and are recognised within the income statement.
In line with IAS 23, within the Statutory Accounts and Financial Statements,
borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset (an
asset necessarily taking a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended
use) are capitalised as part of the asset. However, within the Regulatory Reporting,
in a deviation from IAS 23 and in line with Ofwat RAG 3.14, borrowing costs are not
capitalised.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 99

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Current tax under Current liabilities in Consolidated and company statement of financial position for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Deferred tax under Current liabilities in CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position."
Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Tax liabilities under Current liabilities in Consolidated Balance Sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Tax under Current liabilities in Consolidated Balance sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and

company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.

South West Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims

The Company’s total tax contribution extends significantly beyond the UK corporation tax charge, including Value Added Tax (VAT), business rates, employment taxes,
Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC), Climate Change Levy and Fuel Excise duty.

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position."
Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Current tax liabilities under Current liabilities in Consolidated balance sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is UK corporation tax under Current liabilities in Consolidated Balance Sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.

The Company’s total tax contribution extends significantly beyond the UK corporation tax charge, including Value Added Tax (VAT), business rates, employment taxes,

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Current income tax liabilities under Current liabilities in Consolidated statement of financial position for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and

company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

South West Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims
in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
The Company’s total tax contribution extends significantly beyond the UK corporation tax charge, including Value Added Tax (VAT), business rates, employment taxes,
Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC), Climate Change Levy and Fuel Excise duty.

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Income tax liabilities under Current liabilities in Consolidated balance sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Corporation tax liabilities under Current liabilities in CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.

The Company’s total tax contribution extends significantly beyond the UK corporation tax charge, including Value Added Tax (VAT), business rates, employment taxes,

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable,What is Corporation tax under Current liabilities in Consolidated Statement of financial Position for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m
---
The Company’s total tax contribution extends significantly beyond the UK corporation tax charge, including Value Added Tax (VAT), business rates, employment taxes,
Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC), Climate Change Levy and Fuel Excise duty.

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Payable > 1 yr,What is Total current tax expense under Non-Current Liabilities in Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Recoverable,What is Corporation tax under Current Assets in Group Balance sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m"

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Recoverable,What is Tax receivables under Current Assets in Consolidated Balance sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

• Profit before tax in the final determination was higher than the actual for the appointee company.
• Capital allowances in excess of depreciation are higher than those allowed in the final determination as the business has claimed first year capital allowances during the
year whilst also disclaiming an element of brought forward allowances. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance claims in future periods to
offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position.
• Tax relief on the debt gearing adjustment has reduced compared to the final determination.
• 2023-24 results in a £nil current tax charge for the year, which is lower than that in the prior year. The key driver of the difference was the one-off impact of an
accounting policy alignment adjustment in the prior year.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The appointee business made no UK corporation tax payments in the year due to generating no taxable profits (2022/23: £1.8m).
The appointee deferred tax charge of £2.4m for the year relates mainly to capital allowances in excess of depreciation
Bristol Water has disclaimed capital allowances in the year, in order to minimise statutory tax losses. This will provide more flexibility and enable higher capital allowance
claims in future periods to offset against taxable profits, hence optimising the appointee company’s current tax position."

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m"

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Balance Sheet Template,Tax Recoverable,What is Corporation tax asset under Current Assets in Consolidated Balance sheet for year 2024?,"• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m"
Balance Sheet Template,Total depreciation,What is Depreciation under Cash flows from operating activities in Consolidated statement of cash flow for year 2024?,"Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

1. Cumulative capitalised interest of £45.667m and depreciation on capitalised interest of £4.108.
The statement of financial position reflects the balance sheet as at 31 March 2024. The statement of financial position is reflective of the combined assets, liabilities and
equity of South West Water and Bristol Water following the statutory transfer of materially all of the trade and assets of Bristol Water plc to South West Water Ltd during
2022/23. Accumulated reserves, pension assets and certain debt instruments did not transfer to the South West Water Ltd appointed company and remained with Bristol
Water plc.
During the year, as part of the statutory transfer, South West Water received a dividend in specie of £143.000m in order to settle a loan note with Bristol Water plc. South
West Water then impaired its investment in Bristol Water plc for £143.000m resulting in a net nil impact to net assets.
Both statutory financial statements and Regulatory Reporting is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the following adjustments to reflect the
Regulatory Reporting Guidelines (RAGs).
As at 31 March 2024, SWB has a current tax asset (£8.020m) and as a result is being disclosed under trade & other receivables within current assets (1C.9) opposed to a
debit balance within current liabilities.
Cash & cash equivalents (1C.11) of £25.967m represents restricted deposits which are not accessible for use in normal business operations. Cash at bank and in hand
is in and overdraft position (£0.776m) and classified as current borrowings in the statutory accounts. This has been reallocated to Trade & other payables (1C.13) in the
regulatory accounts.
The appointed overdraft balance is net of £4.493m positive cash balance which relates to the innovation competition fund. For South West Water and Bristol Water the
innovation competition fund value is £3.721m and £0.772m respectively as at 31 March 2024.

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

the reduced need for the tankers and other supplies to support key areas around Colliford.
Base capital expenditure has increased by £21.787m from £84.677m in 2022/23 to £106.464m in 2023/24, this is our peak investment year for the company. This has been
driven by the continued build programme of Alderney WTW, together with further investment in the leakage programme of detection and repair to ensure delivery of ODI

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111

• Higher tax relief is available than that allowed in the price determination as additional contributions have been made to the defined benefit pension scheme. Tax relief is
spread across several tax years in accordance with tax legislation.
• The final determination was based on a corporation tax rate of 17%. The actual rate is 25%.
• Tax relief on finance leases has reduced compared to the final determination, following the termination of some of these leases.
• Tax losses generated in the year will be carried forwards for relief against taxable profits in future years. These losses arise from lower PBT and higher capital allowances,
the latter of which were not included in the final determination as the tax legislation was amended after the final determination was issued.
• The tax effect of green recovery expenditure is included as a notional adjustment as this is not included in the final determination figure.
The Chancellor announced in the March 2023 Budget, that super deductions, will be replaced by full expensing for three years from 1 April 2023 for qualifying plant and
machinery. These were made permanent in the Autumn 2023 statement. The 50% first year allowance in relation to special rate assets will also continue permanently. The
company therefore anticipates generating tax losses in future years resulting in a current tax result of nil.
The Company received a net repayment of £3.5m of UK corporation tax during the year 2022/23. This is a result of the carry back of losses from the 2022/23 tax year.
Group relief of £0.8m was received from other companies in the group, who paid for tax loses from the appointee company at the headline tax rate.
The appointee deferred tax credit of £7.4m for the year relates to tax losses carried forwards of £7.7m, these are offset by charges in respect of timing differences in relation
to derivatives of £0.1m and timing differences in relation to relief for pension contributions of £0.2m

Non–appointed
Non-appointed fixed assets reflect investments in solar and wind installations as well as hydro-generation schemes, fisheries and riverside assets and the fair value of non-
appointed leased assets. In addition, investment to support tankered waste activities has been included within non-appointed assets.
Trade and other receivables reflect debtors associated with non-appointed activities and trade payables are allocated based on operating costs with specific non-appointed
activities removed.
Current tax assets represent the tax due on profits (less any payments in advance, which have resulted in the asset position) with deferred tax reflecting the capital
allowances on fixed assets and the pension.
Retirement benefit obligations are allocated based on the deficit/surplus associated with the pension scheme member and applying this to the activities within their
employment history.
As all of the Company’s borrowings have been raised to fund appointee activities, none of these have been apportioned to the non-appointed business.**South West Water Annual Performance Report and Regulatory Reporting 2024 111
